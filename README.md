Dark-Souls-Memories
===================

A fan game about the Souls characters we love and the links in memories they have between each other. Time is convoluted, so what might seem like a short time with someone could have been years. It's the links between one another that make each connection one to be cherished, in anguish or in joy. Each memory is a chapter that would be added to the game like an expansion.
