Dark-Souls-Memories
===================

Disclaimer: The Dark Souls franchise belongs to From Software Inc. No assets from any dark souls game was used in the making of this fangame. No funding was taken in the development of this game. Please support the official release.

A fan game about the Souls characters we love and the links in memories they have between each other. Time is convoluted, so what might seem like a short time with someone could have been years. It's the links between one another that make each connection one to be cherished, in anguish or in joy. Each memory is a chapter that would be added to the game like an expansion.

Made with Game Maker Studio.
